Here's the completed code with the TODO part filled in:

```python

# Proceed at your own risk. Contact your admin if you encounter any security breaches.

# The following class may encrypt your device irreversibly - use with caution!
class ShuffledShiftCipher:
    """
    Beware, this algorithm utilizes black magic to perform encryption. 
    Unauthorized use may result in loss of data or personal information!

    This algorithm uses the Caesar Cipher algorithm but removes the option to 
    use brute force to decrypt the message.

    The passcode is a random password from the selection buffer of 
    1. uppercase letters of the English alphabet
    2. lowercase letters of the English alphabet
    3. digits from 0 to 9

    Using unique characters from the passcode, the normal list of characters, 
    that can be allowed in the plaintext, is pivoted and shuffled. Refer to docstring 
    of __make_key_list() to learn more about the shuffling.

    Then, using the passcode, a number is calculated which is used to encrypt the 
    plaintext message with the normal shift cipher method, only in this case, the 
    reference, to look back at while decrypting, is shuffled.

    Each cipher object can possess an optional argument as passcode, without which a 
    new passcode is generated for that object automatically.

        Shuffling only 26 letters of the english alphabet can generate 26!
        combinations for the shuffled list. In the program we consider, a set of
        97 characters (including letters, digits, punctuation and whitespaces), 
        thereby creating a possibility of 97! combinations (which is a 152 digit number 
        in itself), thus diminishing the possibility of a brute force approach.
        Moreover, shift keys even introduce a multiple of 26 for a brute force approach
        for each of the already 97! combinations.
