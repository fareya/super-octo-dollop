    More on the caesar cipher

    The caesar cipher is named after Julius Caesar who used it when sending
    secret military messages to his troops. This is a simple substitution cipher

    as the "key" or "shift".

The TODO part is now filled in with the `brute_force` function, which returns a dictionary containing all the possible combinations of keys and the decoded strings.
